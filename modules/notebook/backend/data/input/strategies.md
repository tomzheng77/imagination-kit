### Braindump
- alpha proportional to time
- momentum relative to bitcoin
- liquid market - longer term horizon
- ADL: long position, all short positions get margin call, special consideration
- portfolio allocation when there are multiple signals
- where is the alpha? where is possibly the alpha?
- lower trading freq, lower than 50 per day, etc etc implications
- same trading strategy on all coins, sort by sharpe ratio
- on average slighly worse
- trade price has bid/ask bias
- could use the next open
- trade price naturally in favor of reversion
- conclusion: momentum may not exist but is not very strong
  - image: backtesting graph goes up and down
- higher frequency (sub-minute) may contain momentum
- don't trade against jump (trading)
- QQ: relative to bitcoin contains momentum?

#### Overtrade
- RSI index? price goes too high then it should reverse
- strategy: trade against aggressive order
- market maker thinking: if ask gets hit ask gets increased
  - we should: follow the direction of the market maker, but if flow too strong, trade against
  - graph goes up and up in backtesting
    - indicating this is a good direction
  - taker > 50% obv then buy
    - trade against the taker bolume
- flow is partially uncorrelated
- as long as diversification in trader, then possibility to enter
  - fundamentally we use data to analyze behavior
- retail push - try to trade against
  - need to add and analyze more memecoins
- smaller mkt cap bigger sharpe should happen
- if they can survive then they ... probably have some strategy
  - not a good idea to trade against them
- 12.6 bips per trade (bip is 0.01%)
- need to logically consider what coins to add and what to not
- find coins where the individual traders drive the price
- ??? indicator try to find which ones have large institutions
  - trade count ... ... ...
- monthly market cap - number of coins
- need to not let institutions trigger trade against
- hedge using BTC if it moves following BTC
- can trade using pair
- volumes to number of trades ratio to determine the ###
- match trade with orderbook to see if it was a take* trade
- coin moves overtakes bitcoin - almost certain is news
  - trading against news is dangerous
- eth up layer2 hasn't up trades (but not the other way)
  - sell eth and trade for layer2
  - bitcoin -> largecap -> midcap -> memecoins
    - eventually tick-level follow
- third graph, drops are trades against the news
- buy and hold for 30m can have sharpe > 2
- narrowing down the net of the alpha - where is the alpha?
  - then we can go onto the actual exchange BOOM

### Market Movements
- seeing whales transfer into the market and transfer out
- if you move your coins to the exchange you are going to SELL
  - the coin price is probably going to go down
- Arkham pricings
- if you see the whale transfers
  - alternative data, large transfer data BOOM DB, possible edge

### Computation Pricing
- dozens of coins
- dozens of trades within BTC

### Reaction-Delay of Key Information
- e.g. ELON MUSK sends a tweet
  - are you fast enough to participate in the trade
- token sentiment
- app.alphascan.xyz
- 10 meme coins - understand them ???
- solana memecoins, AVAX memecoins
- independently find which ??? work, with low institution ratio
  - if these match despite independent research, then this can potentially be a signal

### Exchanges to Use
- bitget & buybit for perpetual
- bitget fee: ???
- perpetual leverage ?? 100x lev

### Strategy
- find 10 coins
- use emperical observations rather than parameter overfit
- use the last month of data as test set
- overall feel: much easier than traditional market
- daily use of crypto by Argentinians and Africans
